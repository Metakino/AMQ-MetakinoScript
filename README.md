# Metakino's AMQ Script
It's more of a way for me to learn Javascript, so most of them aren't too much developped and just tests scripts.  
Maybe later in the future I'll make some bigger ones or just improve my tests script, I'll see if I get gud enough.

To install them, just select you wanted one (There's just one for the moment, no need to hesitate) and click on "Raw".  
Then if you have Tampermonkey it should ask you to install it directly. If you don't, download Tampermonkey extension on your browser beforehand.

## Update Hotkey

First script just to try it out.  
Simply add Hotkeys to update your list without going into the settings.

- Anilist : Alt + R
- Kitsu : Alt + T
- MyAnimeList : Alt + Y

It should be working... I hope    
Though if you wanna change your list, you still have to go in the settings. It's just if like you've got some new bulli entries and to avoid 2 useless clicks. (hello laziness)

## List Saving

### **!! UNFINISHED SCRIPT !!**
 
The goal of this script is to allow you to save several lists (If you play on a few different lists or for your training lists) and to load them into the game within just a few clicks.

TODO : 
- Setup the localStorage for the Lists
- Make functional the saving function
- Create de window "Loading Saved List"
- Make functional the loading function
- Basically everything apart the "Saving list" interface
- And also rename "Preset List" into "Saved List" coz I'm a lil retard â™¿
