# AMQ-MetakinoScript
My scripts for AMQ.  
It's more of a way for me to learn Javascript, so most of them aren't too much developped and just tests scripts.  
Maybe later in the future I'll make some bigger ones or just improve my tests script, I'll see if I get gud enough.

## Update Hotkey

First script just to try it out.  
Simply add Hotkeys to update your list without going into the settings.

- Anilist : Alt + R
- Kitsu : Alt + T
- MyAnimeList : Alt + Y

It should be working (I hope)  
Though if you wanna change your list, you still have to go in the settings. It's just if like you've got some new bulli entries and to avoid 2 useless clicks. (hello laziness)
