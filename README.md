# Metakino's AMQ Script
It's more of a way for me to learn Javascript, so most of them aren't too much developped and just tests scripts.  
Maybe later in the future I'll make some bigger ones or just improve my tests script, I'll see if I get gud enough.

To install them, just select you wanted one (There's just one for the moment, no need to hesitate) and click on "Raw".  
Then if you have Tampermonkey it should ask you to install it directly. If you don't, download Tampermonkey extension on your browser beforehand.

## Update Hotkey

### ver 1.0 - stable (No bug reported *yet*)

First script just to try it out.  
Simply add Hotkeys to update your list without going into the settings.

- Anilist : Alt + R
- Kitsu : Alt + T
- MyAnimeList : Alt + Y

It should be working... I hope    
Though if you wanna change your list, you still have to go in the settings. It's just if like you've got some new bulli entries and to avoid 2 useless clicks. (hello laziness)

## List Saving & Quick Loading

### ver 1.0 - stable (No bug reported *yet*)
 
This script allows you to save lists and load them quickly without having to write its name in settings each time (For those who are playing on different lists or with training lists).

To save a list, go to **Settings -> Anime List -> Open List Saving Interface**. Then write the name of the list you want to save, choose the site it's on and save it.

Once this done, you can open the List Loading window at any moment in the game by **pressing Alt+Q**. Then you just have to load the list you want and... play :)

You can save up to **5 lists** for the moment. More list means bigger interface *(so hard to not look ugly)* and I doubt anybody uses billion of lists anyway. Might increase the cap later though.
